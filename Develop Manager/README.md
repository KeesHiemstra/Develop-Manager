# Develop Manager

I can start a project under the 'wrong' solution. Moving a project to another solution is pretty easily. But sometimes I move the project but forget to link the right solution.

The previous experiment was not function well and sometimes it was pointing to a wrong solution.

I created a new plain `Console app` and the algorithm was working.

The environ setting GitDev point to the rootfolder where the sources located.
